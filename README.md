# Module 5 Challenge:  PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this project was to look at a sample of rides from PyBer and create an analysis looking at the
total weekly fares for each city type between the period 1/1/2019 and 4/28/2019.

## Results

Using Jupyter Notebooks we were able to take the data which had the date, fares, city, and city type. 

Some totals of note from that data are as follows

- Total Rides:
  Rural        125
  Suburban     625
  Urban      1,625

- Total Drivers:
  - Rural          537
  - Suburban     8,570
  - Urban       59,602

- Total Fares:
    - Rural        $4,327.93
    - Suburban    $19,356.33
    - Urban       $39,854.38
    
- Average Fare Per Ride:  
    - Rural        $34.62
    - Suburban     $30.97
    - Urban        $24.53

- Average Fare Per Driver:
    - Rural          $865.59
    - Suburban     $1,382.60
    - Urban        $1,077.15

The analysis was able to show the following line graph of the weekly fares for each of three categories of 
cities:  Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

## Summary
We can see from the last chart that total urban fares out-paced total suburban fares which in turn out paced 
total rural fares for the entirety of the date-range.  There are three suggestions for resolving this disparity.

1. Focus on getting more rural and, to a lesser degree, suburban drivers.  The average fares are higher for 
rural and suburban rides compared to urban rides and therefore we can get more revenue with lesser additions of
drivers.
2. Similarly, focus on getting more rural and suburban cities represented (and therefore more drivers).  The 
While the result of more drivers is the same as #1, the focus is less on adding drivers in cities we already
service, and more on servicing more cities.
3. Accept the disparity.  The disparity may be caused simply by supply and demand.  There are less drivers in
rural areas because there is less population and therefore less rides.  The adding of more drivers will suffer
diminishing returns steeply and make the drivers we currently have upset because of lost fares.
